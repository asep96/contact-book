# contact-book

This app uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript so users can create their own online contact book. It contains cards for each contact that consists of  the contact's name, phone number, and email address. Users can create new contacts, update existing contacts, and delete ones they no longer wish to include. For the time being each contact is stored in an object, but I am looking to implement a better storage method at a later date.
